    spread id

    ingredient egg = (@)4,4(@)
    ingredient egg2 = (@)rollOut...egg(@)
    
    el1, el2 = rollOut...egg
    spread will be difficult semantically, can consider not using it
    Done: 
    switch out the -- (name) with what it actually is
        ex: -- addAPinch should be -- if
    | Exp in Stmt so that we can go to 
    store ;) as keyword terminate, then put it where it would be applicable
        otherwise scrap it and delete it where it is now
    * Did we ge rid of degrees?

    Todo: 
    redo the Exp so that instead of nonempty lists, make it recursive
        ex: Exp1 = Exp1 && Exp2
    do we want a break to be allowed randomly by itself in a program
        consider moving it, look at realhotgirlsscript for ex.
        semantically it can be enforced 
        different groups do break differently
    recommended we expand the rules the normal way with left and right
        associativity instead of the NonemptyListOf since it will make 
        AST trees easier later on
    "(@)" ((id | Literal) ("," (id | Literal))*)? "(@)" ";)"  --array
    do the same for dictionary as with array^
    *can delete CollecDec since it is in Exp so VarDec will cover it*
    !!!types for arrays and dictionaries??? so that each thing is the same!!!
    for Params do ListOf
