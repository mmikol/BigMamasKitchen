## Introduction

Welcome to the Kitchen!! Big Mama is strong, bold, loves cute things (such as her cat, Katchup), and cultivates the most flavorful dishes for her consumers. After a few minutes in her kitchen your taste buds are sure to be left tingling. She will throw in a wide variety of flavors from spicy to sweet, from tangy to salty, and will always finish a job with a sassy wink. Better get your plates ready, are you ready for a taste?

This language is for people who love to cook as it uses cooking/baking phrases. BigMamasKitchen serves to spice up statically typed/scoped languages.

(31 pts) Complete the first pass of the design of the language that you will be writing a compiler for during this term. Give your language description on the README.md file of a public GitHub repository you will be setting up for the project. You should have, in your README:
A nice logo
The name of your language, in a large font (unless the language name is readable from the image)
BigMamasKitchen

A list of features
Statically typed, declare the type when adding in parameters or also when declaring new variables

## Example Programs

Lots of example programs. You can do the “your language on the left, JavaScript on the right” presentation style.

### Hello, World!

<table>
  <tr>
  <th>BigMamasKitchen</th>
  <th>JavaScript</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>

```
mama.says("Hello world!") ;)
```

  </td>
  <td>

```JavaScript
console.log(“Hello world!”);
```

  </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Sum of Two Numbers

<table>
  <tr>
  <th>BigMamasKitchen</th>
  <th>JavaScript</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>

```
recipe bitter Add throw in bitter a, bitter b (^-^)~
serve a + b ;)
~(^-^)
```

</td>
  <td>

```JavaScript
function Add (a, b) {
 return a + b;
 }
```

  </td>
  </tr>
</table>

**these should be in conntrol flow i think**

Add a pinch until i < -35 (^-^)~
mama.says(“too cold”) ;)
~(^-^) or substitute until i > 35 (^-^) ~
mama.says(“just right”) ;)
~(^-^) dump leftovers (^-^)~
mama.says(“try again!”) ;)
~(^-^)

if (i < -35) {
console.log(“too cold”);
} else if (i > 35) {
console.log(“just right”);
} else {
console.log(“try again!”);
}
